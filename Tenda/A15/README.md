### 1.lan_ip

#### Vulnerability analysis

I originally planned to hunt for vulnerabilities related to command injection, but accidentally discovered a backdoor vulnerability in the TendaTelnet function. 

In the TendaTelnet function, the value of lan_ip is first obtained from the configuration file, then all telnetd processes are killed, and a telnet service is opened for the router ip.

History is always astonishingly similar. 

If you don't have any ideas, go flip through CVE and there will be surprises.
